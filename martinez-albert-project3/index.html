A sketch may serve a number of purposes: it might record something that the artist sees, it might record or develop an idea for later use or it might be used as a quick way of graphically demonstrating an image, idea or principle" (

                    <q>The definition of sketch sounds bland and pretty boring. How does this help me besides wining a spelling-bee.</q>I'll admit that the definition is underselling the word a bit. The art of sketching really shines and '<i>over-delivers</i>' when you

                    <strong>can</strong>do with it. One thing I always say is

                <!-- item 1 -->
                <li>Writing tool: pencil, pen (that has ink), marker (that works), anything you feel most comfortable holding in your hand that can produce markings on this next item on the list.</li>
                <!-- item 2 -->
                <li>Paper: No not <a href="https://www.fiftythree.com/paper">Paper by 53</a>,
                    <em>actual</em>physical paper that you can draw on with a regular pencil or any writing utensil. If paper isn't your style then of course use any surface that is comfortable for you. With paper and pencil you feel more at ease to just scribble something out and on to the next doodle. It is a very liberating experience, I urge you to try different options and see what works best for you.</li>
                <!-- item 3 -->
                <li>An open mind: Leaving the mind open to all possibilities leaves the sketch artist with a clear objective mind free from objections or boundaries. Your allowing your fullest drawing potential to come alive. This is why you don't have to be an amazing artist to sketch, you don't have to know how to draw. Draw what comes natural to you. When you leave those kinds of judgements or unrealistic expectations on yourself, you sike yourself out from even trying.</li>

                    <em>clear mind</em>. Relax and let your ideas flow from you to the paper through your drawing tool. Breathe and have fun!
