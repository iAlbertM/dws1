						<dd>"A rapidly executed freehand drawing that is not usually intended as a finished work. A sketch may serve a number of purposes: it might record something that the artist sees, it might record or develop an idea for later use or it might be used as a quick way of graphically demonstrating an image, idea or principle" (<cite><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketch_(drawing)">Wikipedia</a>, 2014</cite>).</dd>

					<p>So, in other words,<em>sketching</em>is creating an 'in the moment' rough or preliminary drawing of something.</p>

					<h2>Are You Ready?</h2>
					<p>Ready for what, you ask? Well I know some of you may be thinking,<q>"That's cool and all but so what, if we know the definition of sketching, I'm not trying to win a spelling be."</q> I'll admit that the definition is underselling the word a bit. The art of sketching really shines and '<i>over-delivers</i>' when you <em>discover</em> everything you<strong>can</strong> do with it. One thing I always say is<q>You are limited only by the restraints YOU bestow on your imagination.</q></p>

					<p>To give you an example, I use sketching to help me get out of a creative block, to quickly sketch out ideas for a clients logo design project during a consultation. that we know what sketching is, that's great and all but what can we with it?

					<ul>
						<li>Discover new points of view on a particular subject</li>

						<li>You can introduce yourself to a new style of drawing you weren't aware of</li>

					<h1>Explore Sketching Materials</h1>
				</header>
				<h2>What you need:</h2>
				<ul class="materials-list">
					<!-- item 1 -->
					<li>Writing tool: pencil, pen (that has ink), marker (that works), anything you feel most comfortable holding in your hand that can produce markings on this next item on the list.</li>
					<!-- item 2 -->
					<li>Paper: No not <a href="https://www.fiftythree.com/paper">Paper by 53</a>, <em>actual</em> physical paper that you can draw on with a regular pencil or any writing utensil. If paper isn't your style then of course use any surface that is comfortable for you. 
					<span>Quick Note: Generally speaking in my experience if you start on the computer or tablet, I found that I will continue working on something even though I don't like it anymore or want to try a different direction but because so much effort has already been spent creating this computer sketch I end up wasting a lot of time on 1 thing (this is no longer called a sketch). With paper and pencil you feel more at ease to just scribble something out and on to the next doodle. It is a very liberating experience, I urge you to try different options and see what works best for you.</span></li>
					<!-- item 3 -->
					<li>An open mind: Leaving the mind open to all possibilities leaves the sketch artist with a clear objective mind free from objections or boundaries. Your allowing your fullest drawing potential to come alive. This is why you don't have to be an amazing artist to sketch, you don't have to know how to draw. Draw what comes natural to you. When you leave those kinds of judgements or unrealistic expectations on yourself, you sike yourself out from even trying.</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="bq">
					<blockquote>So a
						<em>writing tool</em>, a
						<em>canvas</em> of your choice, a
						<em>positive attitude</em>, and a
						<em>clear mind</em>. Relax and let your ideas flow from you to the paper through your drawing tool. Breathe and have fun!
