I'll admit that the definition is underselling the word a bit but when it 'over-delivers' it is nothing short of impressive. Fortunately the impressiveness of a sketch comes from everything you<em>can do</em>with it. One thing I always say is<q>You are limited only by the restraints you bestow on your imagination.</q></p>

                    <li>Writing tool: pencil, pen (that has ink), marker (that works), anything you feel most comfortable holding in your hand that can produce markings on this next item on the list.</li>
                    <li>Paper: No not <a href="https://www.fiftythree.com/paper">Paper by 53</a>, <em>actual</em> physical paper that you can draw on with a regular pencil or any writing utensil. If paper isn't your style then of course use any surface that is comfortable for you. 
                    <span class="blue">Quick Note: Generally speaking in my experience if you start on the computer or tablet, I found that I will continue working on something even though I don't like it anymore or want to try a different direction but because so much effort has already been spent creating this computer sketch I end up wasting a lot of time on 1 thing (this is no longer called a sketch). With paper and pencil you feel more at ease to just scribble something out and on to the next doodle. It is a very liberating experience, I urge you to try different options and see what works best for you.</span></li>
                    <li>An open mind: Leaving the mind open to all possibilities leaves the sketch artist with a clear objective mind free from objections or boundaries. Your allowing your fullest drawing potential to come alive. This is why you don't have to be an amazing artist to sketch, you don't have to know how to draw. Draw what comes natural to you. When you leave those kinds of judgements or unrealistic expectations on yourself, you sike yourself out from even trying.</li>
